# Asellion Front-end assignment (Senior-Level)

## Introduction

Your challenge will be to create a simple Angular application (min 10.x) with two main user stories. Please make sure that your application compiles and will work in the best possible way.

## Story 1: As a visitor, I want to see the list of products.

As a visitor, upon opening the application, I want to be presented with a list of all products.

## Acceptance Criteria

For this story, we would like to see the list of products. The number of products should be at least three. Each product should contain these fields:

-   id (pick something suitable)
-   name (string)
-   currentPrice (number)
-   lastUpdate (Date)

## Story 2: As a visitor, I want to update product's data.

By clicking on a product, the visitor can see the product details, and this sub-page is where the visitor can find product specific information.

## Acceptance Criteria

Product details are displayed in a form; here, the visitor can update or delete products.

On the main page, the visitor can click on a button to add a product, where the product form is displayed for the user to enter the product data.

## Non functional requirements

-   You should use Angular
-   You should use Ngrx to represent the app state
-   You should create your own `object` provided by a "fake backend" where the needed data can be requested.
